## Mandala Art  Midterm

Discriptions 📓:
  - I made it pink to represent my president for incoming 2022 presdent election.
  - I made the mindala with circles only
  - I add colors that similar to pink so they can look good at the same time.
  - I used "black" color background so that the colors can stand out.
  - I want to make it look like a flower at the end and with the color white, a symbolism of hope and purity.
